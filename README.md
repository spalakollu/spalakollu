# Hi, I'm Sai Vamsy Palakollu

Senior Principal Consultant & AI Systems Architect — building production-grade autonomous systems at the intersection of agentic AI, quantitative finance, and real-world platforms.

## 🚀 Major Ecosystems

I build and maintain large-scale systems as cohesive ecosystems, with a strong emphasis on correctness, safety, and production readiness.

### QuantTradingOS
A multi-agent framework for systematic trading, designed to bridge legacy C# trading infrastructure with modern Python-based AI agents.

- Market regime detection agents
- Risk management and capital protection (Capital Guardian)
- Sentiment and signal analysis
- Polyglot agent orchestration using MCP

### Layover AI
A live, cross-platform travel social network integrating real-time flight intelligence with AI-driven social experiences.

- 🤖 AI-powered recommendations and assistants  
- ✈️ Real-time flight intelligence  
- 💬 Secure social interactions between verified travelers  
- 📍 Airport discovery and time-aware planning

## 🧠 MCP & Agentic AI (Open Source)

I am actively building **production-oriented open-source patterns for MCP (Model Context Protocol)**, focusing on safety, observability, testing, and deployment of agentic systems.

### MCP Repositories
- **mcp-server-template-python** — Production-ready MCP server template (Python)
- **mcp-toolkit-examples** — Safe and scoped MCP tool design patterns
- **mcp-agent-safety-playbook** — Governance and human-in-the-loop patterns for agentic AI
- **mcp-observability** — Logging, audit, metrics, and tracing patterns for MCP systems
- **mcp-testing-playbook** — Testing and validation strategies for MCP tools and servers
- **mcp-deployment-patterns** — Deployment patterns for running MCP servers safely in production

These repositories form a cohesive lifecycle:
**build → design → govern → observe → test → deploy**
